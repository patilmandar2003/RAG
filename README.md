## Setting up LangSmith

LangSmith helps in debugging and monitoring LangChain applications. To enable LangSmith tracing, set up the required environment variables.

Run the following commands in terminal before executing the project:

export LANGSMITH_TRACING="ture"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="pass_api_key_here"

*Note*: These variables will reset once you close the terminal
